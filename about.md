## What is ManyBabies?

The **ManyBabies** consortium was born in 2015 committed to Open Science and to collaborative research practices that allow teams to test hypotheses about infant development that individual labs could perhaps never adequately test. You can read the blog post that led to the formation of **ManyBabies** [here](https://babieslearninglanguage.blogspot.com/2015/12/the-manybabies-project.html).<br>

**MB's** collaborative nature implies that all project decisions (e.g., research question, study design, stimulus creation, piloting, data collection, analysis, interpretation of the findings, and writing) are made using a consensus-based approach. <br>

We strive for an environment of trust and equality that can engage researchers from a broad spectrum of backgrounds. To learn more about **MB's** vision for the role of large-scale collaborations, see [*Frank et al. (2017)*](https://psyarxiv.com/27b43/) and [*Byers-Heinlein et al. (2020)*](https://psyarxiv.com/dmhk2/).

## Aims
### **ManyBabies** projects aim to test hypotheses about:
* <b><i>Validity</i></b>: Assess the replicability, generalizability, and robustness of key findings in infancy (effect + effect size + moderators) in consensus paradigms. Note that these paradigms are not necessarily exact replications of seminal studies
* <b><i>Theory</i></b>: Understand infant development across a wide range of ages and experiences (e.g., language and cultural background)
* <b><i>Methods</i></b>: Quantify sources of variability across labs and establish best practices
* <b><i>Diversity</i></b>: Increase diversity of participants, researchers, & research questions

* <b><i>Project Leads</i></b>: Coordinate all aspects of a study (e.g., setting up work groups, guidelines) and ensure that all aspects adhere to the [**MB Code of Conduct**]({{site.baseurl}}/code_conduct/) (see current Project Leads [**here**]({{site.baseurl}}/get_involved/))
* <b><i>Data Contributors</i></b>: Collect data following an experimental protocol 
* <b><i>Project Contributors</i></b>: Create stimuli, protocols, analysis code, and any other relevant tasks
