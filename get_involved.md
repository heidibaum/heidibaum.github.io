## We're excited to have you join our team!
In addition to collecting data, there are many contribution opportunities (e.g., study design, data analysis, writing) which do not require access to an infant lab. <br>
**All are welcome!**

If you know which project you are interested in joining, **you can email one or more of the Project Leads directly**. You are also encouraged to **subscribe to project listservs** to receive project updates and communications (see links below). 

If you're unsure of how you'd like to contribute or you'd like to talk with us about contribution opportunities, please **fill out the <a href="#signupform">Sign-Up Form</a>** and we'll be in touch with you as soon as possible. 

You are also welcome to join us at our **monthly "Drop-in Hours"** (currently held on the first Thursday of each month). Times and links to join via Zoom can be found in our [calendar]({{site.baseurl}}/news/).
