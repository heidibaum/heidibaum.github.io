**ManyBabies (MB)** is a collaborative project for replication and best practices in developmental psychology research. Our goal is to bring researchers together to address difficult outstanding theoretical and methodological questions about the nature of early development and how it is studied. For example:

* Do infants prefer helpers over hinderers?
* When do infants like familiarity and when do they like novelty?
* Do babies find infant-directed speech (babytalk) more interesting than adult-directed speech?

Learn more [about]({{site.baseurl}}/about/) **MB's** origin, goals, people, and [stay up to date]({{site.baseurl}}/news/). Also, for a detailed index of collaborators (+ institutions, countries, studies), check the [**MB** collaborator dashboard](https://manybabies.shinyapps.io/shiny_mb_map/).

## Projects

The broader goals of <b>ManyBabies</b> come together in a set of <a href="{{site.baseurl}}{% link projects.md %}"> collaborative projects</a>. They are organized in <i>main projects</i> (either empirical or methodological), <i>spin-off projects</i>, and <i>secondary analyses</i>. Check out our main projects, together with their affiliated spin-off projects and secondary analyses:
