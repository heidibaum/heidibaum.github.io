**ManyBabies (MB)** is a collaborative project for replication and best practices in developmental psychology research. Our goal is to bring researchers together to address difficult outstanding theoretical and methodological questions about the nature of early development and how it is studied. For example:

* Do infants prefer helpers over hinderers?
* When do infants like familiarity and when do they like novelty?
* Do babies find infant-directed speech (babytalk) more interesting than adult-directed speech?

Learn more [about]({{site.baseurl}}/about/) **MB's** origin, goals, people, and [stay up to date]({{site.baseurl}}/news/). Also, for a detailed index of collaborators (+ institutions, countries, studies), check the [**MB** collaborator dashboard](https://manybabies.shinyapps.io/shiny_mb_map/).
